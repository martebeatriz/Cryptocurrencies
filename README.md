# Cryptocurrencies

Created an analysis of cryptocurrency data.

Demonstrated skills in unsupervised learning, through processessing data, clustering, reducing dimensions, and reducing the principal components using PCA. 

### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA

Using Pandas, preprocessed the dataset in order to perform PCA.

### Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

Applied the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, reduced the dimensions of the DataFrame to three principal components and placed dimensions in a new DataFrame.

### Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

Using the K-means algorithm, created an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then, you’ll ran the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data.

### Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

Creating scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot. Visualized the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components created in Deliverable 2, then created a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
